1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good morning.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
How are you?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm fine, thank you.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The weather is nice today.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, it's very good weather.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What will you do today?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
From the afternoon

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
With friends

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Watch a movie.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That sounds nice.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What movie is it?

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's an action movie.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Me too, action.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I like movies.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's something to look forward to.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But first, let's have lunch.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's eat.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, that's a good idea.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What would you like to eat?

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to eat sushi.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's nice.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I also like sushi.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Do you have any recommended shops?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Do you have it?

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes,

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That place is very

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's delicious.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Thank you.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's go there.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's go!

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I hope the road isn't crowded.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, I agree. I don't like traffic jams.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Shall we go by train?

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes, that might be faster.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The station is this way.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll buy the tickets.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Thank you, I'll wait.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I've bought the tickets.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Thank you. Let's go.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The train will arrive in 5 minutes.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's just right.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, the train has arrived!

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's get on.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There are empty seats.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Lucky us!

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Where do we get off next?

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's the third station.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Got it.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What a beautiful view.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Indeed. Spring is beautiful.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, let's get off!

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes, do you have everything?

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm fine.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Is the store nearby?

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, it's a 5-minute walk.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm looking forward to it!

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's here!

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Wow, what a beautiful store.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's go inside.

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Welcome!

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hello, two people.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Please this way.

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Here's the menu.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Thank you. It's hard to decide.

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Everything looks delicious.

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll have the tuna.

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Then, I'll have the salmon.

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
May I place an order?

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes, go ahead.

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
One tuna and one salmon, please.

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Certainly.

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's exciting!

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm hungry.

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, they've arrived!

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Looks delicious!

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's eat!

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How is it?

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's very tasty!

80
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's good to hear.

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
After eating, it's the movie.

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes, I'm looking forward to it.

83
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Where is the venue?

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's near the station.

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Then, we'll take the train again.

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That's right. Let's walk after eating.

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It will be good exercise.

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm already full.

89
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Shall we go now?

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Could I have the bill, please?

91
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Thank you very much!

92
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thanks for the meal!

93
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The movie theater is this way.

94
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We're almost there.

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Oh, there are a lot of people.

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's a popular movie, isn't it?

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm looking forward to it!

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Do you have a reservation for the seats?

99
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes, it's all set!

100
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's go in!

101
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Nice seats.

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Not too close, not too far back.

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The movie is about to start.

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Do you have popcorn?

105
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Of course, I bought some.

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Thank you!

107
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's be quiet now.

108
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes, it's starting!

109
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Wow, it's so powerful.

110
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The sound is amazing!

111
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Be quiet, other customers...

112
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Sorry.

113
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's okay, let's enjoy it.

114
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This scene is amazing!

115
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm really on the edge of my seat.

116
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, it's over!

117
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That was fantastic!

118
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's been a while since I enjoyed something this much.

119
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's watch a movie together again.

120
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Absolutely!

121
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Well, shall we head home soon?

122
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, I think so.

123
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's already dark outside.

124
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The night breeze feels nice.

125
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Indeed it does.

126
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I had a great day today.

127
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think so too.

128
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's go out again next time.

129
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Of course!

130
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Where shall we go next?

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
How about an amusement park?

132
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Sounds good! The thrill rides!

133
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's a bit scary, but it looks fun!

134
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Then, let's make a plan.

135
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Are you free next Saturday?

136
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes, I'm available!

137
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Alright, it's settled then.

138
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm looking forward to it.

139
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Me too!

140
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We're arriving at the station soon.

141
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Well then, it's time to say goodbye here.

142
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Thank you for today!

143
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You're welcome, I had a great time.

144
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Please be careful on your way home.

145
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes, good night.

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Good night.

147
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll contact you again.

148
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm waiting!

149
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Bye-bye!

150
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Bye-bye!

151
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
(Sound of train)

152
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Today was a good day again.

153
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I hope another fun day will come.

154
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
(Music)

155
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What should I do when I get home?

156
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Take a shower...

157
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And then, I'll play some games.

158
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I bought a new game.

159
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That sounds interesting.

160
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Let's play together next time.

161
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Absolutely!

162
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, I've arrived home.

163
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm home~

164
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Welcome back!

165
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Was it a good day?

166
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes, it was really great.

167
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's good to hear.

168
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm a bit tired though.

169
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Take a good rest.

170
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Thank you.

171
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Well, I'm going to take a shower.

172
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay.

173
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
(Sound of shower)

174
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Phew, I feel refreshed!

175
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Now, it's game time!

176
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Power on!

177
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
(Game startup sound)

178
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm so excited!

179
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
(Game play begins)

180
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Wow, it's hard from the start!

181
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Good luck!

182
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Thank you!

183
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
...Oh, I got defeated!

184
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't worry!

185
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's retry!

186
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This time for sure!

187
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Go!

188
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I cleared it!

189
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Amazing!

190
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Today was a good day.

191
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Delicious food, fun movies,

192
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and games!

193
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's time to sleep now.

194
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Good night.

195
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hope tomorrow will be a good day too.

196
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
(Soft music)

197
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Zzz...

198
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
(Night insects' sounds)

199
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Good night.

200
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
(Fade out)

201
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
(Morning birds chirping)

202
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Good morning.

203
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Did you sleep well?

204
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes, I slept soundly.

205
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's a beautiful weather today.

206
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Indeed. Such a refreshing morning.

207
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What shall we have for breakfast?

208
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I want to eat pancakes.

209
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Then shall we make them together?

210
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes!

211
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Do we have the ingredients?

212
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes, everything is ready.

213
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Then, let's get the eggs and milk...

214
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The flour is here.

215
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Leave the mixing to me!

216
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Wow, you're good at this.

217
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll heat up the frying pan.

218
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It smells so good!

219
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
They're done!

220
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's eat!

221
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yum, it's delicious!

222
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The sweetness is just right.

223
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Happy from the morning~

224
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What are today's plans?

225
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Cleaning and shopping.

226
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll help too!

227
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Thank you, that helps!

228
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
First, the vacuum cleaner.

229
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes, turn it on!

230
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
(Vacuum cleaner sound)

231
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Shall we wipe the windows too?

232
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Sounds good, let's make them sparkling.

233
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Finished!

234
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Good job!

235
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Shall we go shopping now?

236
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Let's go!

237
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Do you have the shopping list?

238
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes, I wrote it on a note.

239
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Then, no forgetfulness!

240
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yep, perfect!

241
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The supermarket is just ahead.

242
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's quite crowded.

243
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Maybe because it's a holiday.

244
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll get the cart.

245
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Thank you!

246
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's start with the vegetables.

247
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Tomatoes and lettuce.

248
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And carrots too.

249
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Got it!

250
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Next is the meat section.

251
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Let's buy chicken and pork.

252
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Ingredients for dinner.

253
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What shall we make today?

254
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Maybe chicken teriyaki.

255
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Sounds delicious!

256
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Please tell me the recipe later.

257
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Of course!

258
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Shall we check out?

259
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The register is over there.

260
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's line up.

261
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The line is quite long...

262
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But it seems to be moving quickly.

263
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay, payment complete!

264
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Thank you~

265
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's head home!

266
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The bags are quite heavy.

267
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's carry them carefully!

268
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's good exercise.

269
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Let's rest a bit when we get home.

270
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes, let's do that.

271
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We're home!

272
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm back~

273
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll put away the groceries.

274
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Thank you!

275
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Would you like some tea?

276
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Sounds good, a little break.

277
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll make some tea.

278
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Thank you. Today has been fulfilling.

279
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Really, it's such a nice day.

280
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I wish days like this would last forever.

281
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes, I agree.

282
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Now, let's start preparing dinner.

283
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll help!

284
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Please cut the vegetables.

285
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Got it!

286
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The rice is already cooked.

287
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Everything's ready!

288
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
All that's left is to cook the chicken.

289
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Sizzle...

290
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It smells so good!

291
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Pour the teriyaki sauce.

292
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's done!

293
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let's eat!

294
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Wow, it's the best!

295
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Thank you for today.

296
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Likewise, I had fun.

297
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Let's continue to do this.

298
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I want to be with you forever.

299
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Me too, forever.

300
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
(Fade out with gentle music)

301
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Thank you for the meal.

302
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It was delicious, wasn't it?

303
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes, it's especially good when we make it ourselves.

304
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Shall we clean up too?

305
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes, let's do it together.

306
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll carry the dishes.

307
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Thank you, I'll wash them.

308
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The sponge is here.

309
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That helps a lot!

310
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's clean now.

311
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Cleaning up feels so refreshing.

312
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Well then, shall we relax a bit?

313
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes, relaxing on the sofa.

314
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Shall we watch TV?

315
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Sounds good. I wonder what's on?

316
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Here's the remote.

317
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Thank you.

318
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The drama has started.

319
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I like this actor.

320
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Their acting is natural and good.

321
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The story is interesting too.

322
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I look forward to it every week.

323
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's watch it again next week!

324
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Of course!

325
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh, it's bath time.

326
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes, it is. Who goes first?

327
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You go ahead.

328
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Thank you. I'll go now.

329
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
(Sound of bath)

330
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Phew, that was a nice bath!

331
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm going in next.

332
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Take care!

333
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
(Relaxing music)

334
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Today went by so quickly.

335
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I wish every day was like this.

336
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
(Coming back from the bath)

337
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I feel refreshed~

338
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I've changed into pajamas!

339
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Let's go to bed soon.

340
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes, I think so.

341
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We have an early day tomorrow.

342
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'll brush my teeth.

343
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'll do it later.

344
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
(Sound of brushing teeth)

345
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Good night first.

346
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Good night.

347
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Sweet dreams.

348
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You too.

349
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
(Quiet night sounds)

350
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
See you tomorrow.

351
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Zzz...

352
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
(Morning after night)

353
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
A new morning has come.

354
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The alarm is ringing.

355
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Good morning~

356
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm still sleepy…

357
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But I have to get up.

358
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let's do our best today!

359
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What shall we have for breakfast?

360
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Just toast and coffee, simple.

361
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay, I'll prepare it!

362
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Thank you!

363
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The aroma of coffee is the best.

364
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm waking up now.

365
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What's today's plan?

366
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Work in the morning, free in the afternoon.

367
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Let's meet again in the afternoon!

368
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yes, looking forward to it!

369
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
See you!

370
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm off!

371
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
(Sound of the front door)

372
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Let's do our best today!

373
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
(Sound of commuting)

374
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Caught the train just in time.

375
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Lucky to get a seat!

376
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Hope today's work goes well.

377
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Arrived~

378
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Good morning!

379
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Thanks for your help today.

380
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Likewise!

381
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
(At work)

382
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000

Almost done.

I'll have a sandwich.

397
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000

Me too!

400
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's already evening in no time.

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Well then, let's go home.

407

The train is coming.

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Just in time!

409
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I wonder what I'll do when I get home.

410
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Maybe have dinner and relax.

411
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm home!

412
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000

425
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm starting to feel sleepy.

426
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Then, it's time to get ready for bed.

427
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Brush your teeth, change into pajamas...

428
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Get into bed...

429
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000

Shall we do a little stretch?

446
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yes, it makes my body feel refreshed.

447
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
(Sound of stretching)

448
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Alright, morning preparations!

449
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000

That would be helpful~

458
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000

00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The city is lively again today.

Many people are walking around.

473
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It seems this cafe just opened.

474
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
