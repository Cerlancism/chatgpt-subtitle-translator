1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good morning.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
How are you?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm fine, thank you.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The weather is nice today.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, it's very good weather.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What will you do today?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
From the afternoon

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
With friends

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We will watch a movie.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That sounds nice.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What kind of movie is it?

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's an action movie.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Me too, action.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I like movies.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That sounds fun.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But, first, lunch.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's eat.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, that's a good idea.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What would you like to eat?

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to eat sushi.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's nice.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I also like sushi.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Do you have any recommended shops?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Do you have it?

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes,

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That place over there is very...

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's delicious.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Thank you.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's go there.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's go!

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I hope the road isn't crowded.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, I agree. I don't like traffic jams.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Shall we go by train?

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes, that might be faster.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The station is this way.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll buy the tickets.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Thank you, I'll wait.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I've bought the tickets.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Thank you. Let's go.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The train will arrive in 5 minutes.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's just right.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, the train has arrived!

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's get on.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There are empty seats.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Lucky us!

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Where do we get off next?

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's the third station.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Got it.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What a beautiful view.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Indeed. Spring is beautiful.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, let's get off!

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes, do you have everything?

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm fine.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Is the store nearby?

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, it's a 5-minute walk.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm looking forward to it!

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's here!

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Wow, what a beautiful store.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's go inside.

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Welcome!

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hello, two people.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Please this way.

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Here's the menu.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Thank you. It's hard to decide.

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Everything looks delicious.

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll have the tuna.

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Then, I'll have the salmon.

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
May I place an order?

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes, go ahead.

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
One tuna and one salmon, please.

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Certainly.

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's exciting!

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm hungry.

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, they've arrived!

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Looks delicious!

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's eat!

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How is it?

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's very tasty!

80
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's good to hear.

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
After we finish eating, it's the movies.

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes, I'm looking forward to it.

83
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Where is the venue?

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's near the station.

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Then, we'll take the train again.

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That's right. Let's walk after eating.

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It will be good exercise.

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm already full.

89
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Shall we go now?

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Could I have the bill, please?

91
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Thank you very much!

92
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thanks for the meal!

93
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The movie theater is this way.

94
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We're almost there.

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Oh, there are a lot of people.

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's a popular movie, isn't it?

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm looking forward to it!

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Have you reserved the seats?

99
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes, perfectly!

100
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's go in!

101
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Nice seats.

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Not too close, not too far back.

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The movie is about to start.

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Do you have popcorn?

105
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Of course, I bought some.

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Thank you!

107
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's be quiet now.

108
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes, it's starting!

109
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Wow, it's so powerful.

110
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The sound is amazing too!

111
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Be quiet, other customers...

112
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Sorry.

113
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's okay, let's enjoy it.

114
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This scene is amazing!

115
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm really on the edge of my seat.

116
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Ah, it's over!

117
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That was fantastic!

118
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's been a while since I enjoyed something this much.

119
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's watch a movie together again.

120
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Absolutely!

121
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Well, shall we head home soon?

122
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, I think so.

123
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's already dark outside.

124
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The night breeze feels nice.

125
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Indeed, it does.

126
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I had a great day today.

127
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think so too.

128
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's go out again next time.

129
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Of course!

130
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Where shall we go next?

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
How about an amusement park?

132
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Sounds good! The thrill rides!

133
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's a bit scary, but it looks fun!

134
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Then, let's make a plan.

135
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Are you free next Saturday?

136
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes, I am!

137
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Then it's settled.

138
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm looking forward to it.

139
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Me too!

140
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We're arriving at the station soon.

141
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Well then, it's time to say goodbye here.

142
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Thank you for today!

143
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You're welcome, I had a great time.

144
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Please be careful on your way home.

145
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes, good night.

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Good night.

147
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll contact you again.

148
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll be waiting!

149
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Bye-bye!

150
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Bye-bye!

151
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
(Sound of train)

152
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Today was a good day again.

153
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I hope another fun day will come.

154
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
(Music)

155
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I wonder what I'll do when I get home.

156
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Take a shower...

157
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And then, I'll play some games.

158
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I bought a new game.

159
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That sounds interesting.

160
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Let's play together next time.

161
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Absolutely!

162
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, I've arrived home.

163
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm home~

164
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Welcome back!

165
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Was it a good day?

166
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes, it was really great.

167
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's good to hear.

168
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm a bit tired though.

169
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Take a good rest.

170
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Thank you.

171
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Well, I'm going to take a shower.

172
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay.

173
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
(Sound of shower)

174
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Phew, I feel refreshed!

175
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Now, it's game time!

176
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Power on!

177
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
(Game startup sound)

178
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm so excited!

179
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
(Game play begins)

180
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Wow, it's hard from the start!

181
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Good luck!

182
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Thank you!

183
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
...Oh, I got defeated!

184
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't worry!

185
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's retry!

186
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This time for sure!

187
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Go!

188
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I cleared it!

189
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Amazing!

190
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Today was a good day.

191
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Delicious food, fun movies,

192
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and games!

193
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's time to sleep now.

194
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Good night.

195
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hope tomorrow will be a good day too.

196
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
(Soft music)

197
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Zzz...

198
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
(Night insects' sounds)

199
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Good night.

200
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
(Fade out)

201
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
(Morning birds chirping)

202
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Good morning.

203
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Did you sleep well?

204
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes, I slept soundly.

205
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's a beautiful weather today.

206
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Indeed. Such a refreshing morning.

207
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What shall we have for breakfast?

208
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I want to eat pancakes.

209
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Then shall we make them together?

210
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes!

211
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Do we have the ingredients?

212
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes, everything is ready.

213
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Then, let's get the eggs and milk...

214
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The flour is here.

215
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Leave the mixing to me!

216
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Wow, you're good at this.

217
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll heat up the frying pan.

218
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I can smell something delicious!

219
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
They're done!

220
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's eat!

221
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Mmm, it's delicious!

222
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The sweetness is just right.

223
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Happy from the morning~

224
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What are today's plans?

225
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Cleaning and shopping.

226
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Then I'll help too!

227
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Thank you, that helps!

228
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
First, let's start with the vacuum cleaner.

229
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes, turn it on!

230
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
(Sound of vacuum)

231
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Shall we also wipe the windows?

232
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Sounds good, let's make them sparkling.

233
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Finished!

234
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Good job!

235
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Shall we go shopping now?

236
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Let's go!

237
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Do you have the shopping list?

238
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes, I wrote it on a note.

239
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Then we won't forget anything.

240
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes, perfect!

241
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The supermarket is just ahead.

242
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's quite crowded.

243
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Maybe because it's a holiday.

244
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll get the cart.

245
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Thank you!

246
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's start with the vegetables.

247
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Tomatoes and lettuce.

248
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And carrots too.

249
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Got it!

250
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Next is the meat section.

251
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Let's buy chicken and pork.

252
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Ingredients for dinner.

253
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What shall we make today?

254
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Maybe chicken teriyaki.

255
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Sounds delicious!

256
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Please tell me the recipe later.

257
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Of course!

258
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Shall we check out?

259
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The register is over there.

260
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's line up.

261
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The line is quite long...

262
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But it seems to be moving quickly.

263
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay, payment completed!

264
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Thank you~

265
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's head home!

266
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The bags are quite heavy.

267
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's carry them carefully!

268
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's good exercise.

269
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Let's rest a bit when we get home.

270
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes, let's do that.

271
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We're back!

272
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm home~

273
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll put away the groceries.

274
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Thank you!

275
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Would you like some tea?

276
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Sounds good, a little break.

277
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll make some tea.

278
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Thank you. Today has been fulfilling.

279
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Really, it's such a nice day.

280
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I wish days like this would last forever.

281
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes, I agree.

282
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Now, let's start preparing dinner.

283
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll help!

284
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Please cut the vegetables.

285
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Got it!

286
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The rice is already cooked.

287
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Everything's ready!

288
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
All that's left is to cook the chicken.

289
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Sizzle...

290
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That smells so good!

291
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'll pour the teriyaki sauce.

292
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's done!

293
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let's eat!

294
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Wow, it's the best!

295
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Thank you for today.

296
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Likewise, I had fun.

297
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Let's keep doing this.

298
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I want to be with you forever.

299
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Me too, forever.

300
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
(Fade out with gentle music)

301
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Thank you for the meal.

302
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That was delicious.

303
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes, it's especially good when we make it ourselves.

304
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Shall I clean up too?

305
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes, let's do it together.

306
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll carry the dishes.

307
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Thank you, I'll wash them.

308
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The sponge is here.

309
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That helps a lot!

310
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's clean now.

311
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Cleaning up feels so refreshing.

312
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Then, shall we relax a bit?

313
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes, relaxing on the sofa.

314
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Shall we watch TV?

315
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Sounds good. I wonder what's on?

316
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Here's the remote.

317
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Thank you.

318
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The drama has started.

319
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I like this actor.

320
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Their acting is so natural, it's great.

321
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The story is interesting too.

322
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I look forward to it every week.

323
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's watch it again next week!

324
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Of course!

325
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh, it's bath time.

326
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes, it is. Who goes first?

327
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You go ahead.

328
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Thank you. I'll go now.

329
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
(Sound of bath water)

330
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Phew, that was a nice bath!

331
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm going in next.

332
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Have a good bath!

333
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
(Relaxing music)

334
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Today went by so quickly.

335
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I wish every day was like this.

336
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
(Coming back from the bath)

337
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Feeling refreshed!

338
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I've changed into my pajamas!

339
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Let's go to bed soon.

340
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes, that's a good idea.

341
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We have an early day tomorrow.

342
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'll brush my teeth.

343
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'll do it later.

344
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
(Sound of brushing teeth)

345
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Good night first.

346
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Good night.

347
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Sweet dreams.

348
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You too.

349
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
(Quiet night sounds)

350
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
See you tomorrow.

351
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Zzz...

352
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
(Morning breaks)

353
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
A new morning has come.

354
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The alarm is ringing.

355
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Good morning!

356
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm still sleepy...

357
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But I have to get up.

358
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let's do our best today!

359
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What should we have for breakfast?

360
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Just toast and coffee, simple.

361
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay, I'll prepare it!

362
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Thank you!

363
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The smell of coffee is wonderful.

364
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm waking up now.

365
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What's today's plan?

366
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Work in the morning, free in the afternoon.

367
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Let's meet again in the afternoon!

368
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yes, I'm looking forward to it!

369
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
See you!

370
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm off!

371
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
(Sound of the front door)

372
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Let's do our best today!

373
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
(Sound of commuting)

374
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Caught the train just in time.

375
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Lucky to get a seat!

376
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Hope everything goes well at work today.

377
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Arrived!

378
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Good morning!

379
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Thanks for your help today.

380
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Likewise!

381
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000

382
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Where was this document?

Progress is going smoothly.

387
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Almost done.

388
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Let's keep it up!

389
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yes!

390
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's lunchtime!

391
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What shall we eat?

392
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Let's go to a nearby cafe!

393
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000

395
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll have pasta.

396
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll have a sandwich.

397
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Looks delicious!

398
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I think I can manage the afternoon.

399
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Me too!

400
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Let's head back now.

401
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes, let's stay focused in the afternoon too!

402
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000

403
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's already evening in no time.

404
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Good job today!

405
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000

406
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Well then, let's go home.

407
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The train is coming, isn't it?

408
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Just in time!

409
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I wonder what I should do when I get home.

410
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Maybe have dinner and relax.

411
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm home!

412
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000

There's leftover curry in the fridge!

416
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Awesome!

(Calm background music)

423
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Let's do our best together again tomorrow.

424
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah!

425
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm starting to feel sleepy soon.

426
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Then, it's time to get ready for bed.

427
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Brush my teeth, change into pajamas...

428
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Get into bed...

429
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Good night.

430
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000

(Night quietness)

433
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
(Sound of stars shining)

434
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The end roll plays.

435
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Thank you for today.

436
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000

(Music fades out)

438
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
To be continued...

439
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Special thanks to you.

440
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Good night.

441
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000

442
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
(Morning sun shines in)

443
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Good morning, a new day begins.

444
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Let's start again today.

445
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Shall we do some stretching?

446
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yes, it makes the body feel refreshed.

447
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
(Stretching sounds)

448
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Alright, morning preparations!

449
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll take a shower.

450
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Have a good day.

451
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
(Shower sounds)

452
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Phew, feeling refreshed!

453
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What shall we have for breakfast?

454
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Today, toast and fried eggs.

455
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Okay, I'll prepare!

456
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'll also make coffee.

457
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Thanks!

458
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Let's eat!

459
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yes, a good start today too!

460
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Thank you for the meal!

461
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Now, let's get ready to go out.

462
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What was today's plan?

463
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Shopping in the morning, walk in the afternoon!

464
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Sounds good, a relaxing day.

465
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The weather looks nice too.

466
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Then, let's prepare and head out.

467
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Wallet, smartphone, keys, all set!

468
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm off!

469
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Take care!

470
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
(Lively outdoor sounds)

471
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The city is lively today too.

472
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Many people are walking around.

473
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It seems this cafe just opened.

474
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Shall we drop by later?

475
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Sounds good!

476
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
First, to the supermarket.

477
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Let's buy while looking at the list.

478
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Vegetables, milk, bread...

479
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And some snacks too.

480
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And ice cream!

481
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Nice~

482
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Let's line up at the register.

483
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It'll be quick.

484
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Payment completed!

485
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Thank you very much~

486
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Now, to that new cafe!

487
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The menu looks stylish.

488
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Maybe I'll try a matcha latte.

489
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'll have a caramel macchiato!

490
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll order now.

491
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The staff is also friendly.

492
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's a nice atmosphere here.

493
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I want to come again.

494
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Really!

495
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Enjoying a delicious drink!

496
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's relaxing~

497
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Now, let's go for an afternoon walk.

498
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Let's go to the park!

499
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The spring breeze feels good.

500
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Let's walk and chat.

501
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Let's sit on the bench and rest for a bit.

502
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Nice, this view is also wonderful.

503
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The leaves of the trees are swaying in the wind.

504
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It feels like time is flowing slowly.

505
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The birds' chirping is also pleasant, isn't it?

506
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh, there's a squirrel over there!

507
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Really! So cute!

508
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Time like this is very healing.

509
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Doing nothing is a luxury, isn't it?

510
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The sunset is gradually tilting.

511
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Shall we head home soon?

512
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yes, let's walk home slowly.

513
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The way back is also quiet and nice.

514
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We walked a lot today.

515
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It was good exercise!

516
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What shall we have for dinner?

517
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I want something light.

518
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Then let's have cold Chinese noodles!

519
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Great idea!

520
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I think we have the ingredients.

521
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Let's make it after we get home.

522
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm back!

523
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Welcome back!

524
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Let's prepare the cold Chinese noodles right away.

525
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Cut the vegetables, boil the noodles...

526
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Shall we make the sauce ourselves?

527
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yes, homemade tastes much better!

528
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's ready!

529
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Let's eat!

530
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Mmm, it tastes like summer!

531
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's refreshing and delicious.

532
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It blows away the fatigue.

533
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Thank you for the meal!

534
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Let's take a bath now...

535
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
How about watching a movie today?

536
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Sounds good! What do you want to watch?

537
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Something heartwarming would be nice.

538
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
How about this animated movie?

539
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Oh, that's one I've wanted to see for a while!

540
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Okay, I'll play it.

541
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
(Playing sound)

542
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The visuals are beautiful!

543
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The music is wonderful.

544
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm drawn into this world.

545
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That character is so cute!

546
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The character is also very nice.

547
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I heard there are tear-jerking scenes in the second half.

548
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Better prepare a handkerchief!

549
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
(Emotional music)

550
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I cried.

551
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Me too... it was a good movie.

552
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
After watching, my heart feels warm.

553
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I want to watch this again.

554
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes, it's a precious film.

555
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Let's go to bed soon.

556
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yes, today was a day full of activity.

557
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Brush my teeth, change into pajamas...

558
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Hope tomorrow will be another good day.

559
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Good night.

560
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Good night~

561
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Zzz...

562
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
(Night insects chirping)

563
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
(Moon visible from the window)

564
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The quiet night passes by...

565
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
...

566
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
(Morning birds chirping)

567
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Good morning.

568
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Did you sleep well yesterday?

569
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yes, I slept soundly!

570
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's a bit cool today.

571
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I can feel the signs of autumn.

572
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What shall we have for breakfast?

573
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Let's have miso soup and rice.

574
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
A Japanese-style breakfast sounds good!

575
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Then, let's dissolve the miso...

576
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Add tofu and wakame seaweed.

577
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Smells so good~

578
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Well then, let's eat!

579
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It has a soothing taste.

580
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's comforting from the morning.

581
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Thank you for the meal!

582
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So, how will you spend today?

583
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I feel like going to the library.

584
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That sounds nice, a relaxing time reading books.

585
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Let's look for a favorite novel.

586
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Let's go out once we're ready!

587
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yes, I'm leaving!

588
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Take care!

589
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
(Quietness of the library)

590
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It has a calm atmosphere.

591
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm interested in that shelf.

592
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah, that book... looks interesting!

593
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Let's read a little.

594
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The sound of flipping pages is pleasant.

595
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I lose track of time reading.

596
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's about time to go home.

597
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Let's borrow this book.

598
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Looking forward to reading more.

599
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
(On the way back)

600
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Would you like to stop by somewhere?

601
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
There's a dango shop.

602
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
We've been tempted by sweets~

603
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Let's get mitarashi dango and anko dango!

604
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I love both!

605
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Let's enjoy!

606
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The sweet and salty flavor is irresistible.

607
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I also want some Japanese tea.

608
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, there might be a tea shop nearby!

609
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Let's stop by for a bit!

610
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Hello~

611
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Welcome!

612
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
May I have some sencha?

613
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yes, I'll bring it right away.

614
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The aroma is really wonderful.

615
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
One sip and I feel so relaxed.

616
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Indeed, a Japanese-style time is nice.

617
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's about time for full autumn now.

618
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I want to go see the autumn leaves.

619
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah, maybe next week!

620
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Let's make some plans.

621
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Another thing to look forward to!

622
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The way home is filled with smiles.

623
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Let's rest a little when we get home.

624
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
We walked a lot today!

625
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Then, let's continue reading the book while drinking tea.

626
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's the best afternoon.

627
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
A quiet time flows luxuriously...

628
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Let's spend a little more time reading like this.

629
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
This novel is interesting because the plot is unpredictable.

630
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The characters are also charming.

631
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I can't help but keep turning the pages.

632
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Oh, it's already this late!

633
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I should start preparing dinner soon.

634
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What should we have today?

635
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
How about stew?

636
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's the season when we want to eat something warm.

637
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I wonder if I have all the ingredients... Yes, I have everything!

638
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Well then, let's start cooking.

639
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Cutting vegetables and simmering them slowly.

640
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
The gentle bubbling sound is so soothing.

641
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The whole room is filled with the aroma of stew.

642
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Is it almost ready?

643
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yes, it looks delicious!

644
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Let's eat.

645
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Wow, it melts in your mouth!

646
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's hot and warms my heart.

647
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Dipping bread into it makes it even more special.

648
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Ah, happiness~

649
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Do we have any dessert?

650
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
There should be pudding in the refrigerator!

651
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Great! Let's eat later!

652
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Would you like to listen to some music after the meal?

653
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah, I feel like listening to some relaxing jazz.

654
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
(Jazz piano music plays)

655
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
This song is nice.

656
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Sitting on the sofa with my eyes closed...

657
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Losing myself in the sound.

658
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's truly a luxurious time.

659
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I might doze off a little.

660
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But it's still too early to sleep.

661
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That's right, I think I'll organize my albums.

662
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
There are many nostalgic photos.

663
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
This one is from elementary school field trip!

664
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Haha, making a funny face~

665
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
This photo is from the school festival, isn't it?

666
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It brings back memories of youth.

667
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Each photo has its own story.

668
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I should organize this album more.

669
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Maybe I should digitize them.

670
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'll try scanning them next time.

671
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Records I want to leave for the future.

672
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Well, it's about time for dessert!

673
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'll have the pudding~!

674
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The sweetness is just right, it's the best.

675
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I can't stop eating with my spoon.

676
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Maybe I should try making this myself?

677
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Nice, homemade pudding!

678
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Let's try making it on the next holiday.

679
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What kind of mold should I use?

680
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
A heart shape, or maybe a star shape!

681
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Our joys have increased again.

682
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Today was a very peaceful day.

683
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The night quietly deepens.

684
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
At the end of the day, I feel grateful.

685
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I hope tomorrow will be another good day.

686
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's about time to sleep, isn't it?

687
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Change into pajamas, brush your teeth...

688
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Get into bed and take a deep breath.

689
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Good night.

690
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
See you tomorrow.

691
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
(The quiet of the night continues)

692
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Zzz...

693
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
(Morning light through the curtains)

694
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Good morning.

695
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's sunny again today!

696
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I feel refreshed upon waking.

697
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Let's go to the balcony to breathe in the morning air.

698
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The breeze is pleasant.

699
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Shall I make some coffee?

700
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
A morning cup is the best.

701
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Today is a perfect day for doing laundry.

702
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Let's also wash the sheets!

703
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Start the washing machine!

704
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
(Sound of the washing machine)

705
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's really nice to hang clothes outside.

706
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I love the smell of the sun.

707
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Now, what should I have for breakfast?

708
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Today, I'll make French toast!

709
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Mix eggs, milk, and sugar...

710
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Soak the bread well and then fry it.

711
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Pour syrup over it, and it's ready!

712
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Let's eat!

713
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Fluffy, sweet, and delicious!

714
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Feeling happy from the morning.

715
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
After eating, let's do some tidying up...

716
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Let's also clean the room.

717
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Vacuum and wipe the surfaces.

718
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Cleaning the windows makes me feel refreshed!

719
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The room is sparkling clean.

720
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Let's take a break now.

721
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Let's play some music...

722
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Shall I make some tea?

723
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm thinking of having green tea today.

724
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Pour hot water into the teapot and steep it carefully...

725
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Take a sip and relax for a moment.

726
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I love this quiet time.

727
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What shall we do this afternoon?

728
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I want to go for a walk.

729
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Shall we walk to the park?

730
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The breeze feels so nice.

731
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm getting ready, see you later!

732
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Take care!

733
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
(Sunlight filtering through the trees in the park)

734
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
There are few people, and it's quiet.

735
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Shall we sit on the bench and read a book?

736
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's the continuation of the book I borrowed last time.

737
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
As I open the page, I am immediately immersed in the story.

738
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
This kind of reading is the best.

739
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Sometimes the wind turns the pages.

740
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I hate to finish reading it.

741
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But I want to know what happens next!

742
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
To the next chapter... but then,

743
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Huh? My stomach just growled.

744
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Is it already that time?

745
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Shall we head home soon?

746
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
On the way back, let's stop by the supermarket.

747
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
What should I make for dinner?

748
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I want to eat hamburger steak today!

749
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Then let's buy the ingredients.

750
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Ground meat, onions, bread crumbs...

751
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Don't forget the eggs and sauce.

752
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The checkout was quick!

753
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Well then, let's go home.

754
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm home!

755
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Welcome back!

756
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Let's start making the hamburger steak right away!

757
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Sauté the onions and let them cool.

758
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Mix with the ground meat and knead it well...

759
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Shape it and fry it until it's sizzling!

760
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It smells so good!

761
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Make the sauce, pour it over...

762
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's done!

763
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Let's eat!

764
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Fluffy and juicy!

765
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It goes well with rice.

766
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So delicious and happy!

767
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
After eating, let's have some tea and chat a bit.

768
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Today was a calm and fun day.

769
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Looking forward to tomorrow again.

770
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Good night.

771
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Zzz...

772
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
(The silence of dawn)

773
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Good morning.

774
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Today is the weekend.

775
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm thinking about what to do.

776
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
That's right, how about a picnic in the park after a long time?

777
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Sounds good! Let's prepare a lunchbox.

778
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Let's make rice balls with lots of ingredients!

779
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
What side dishes should we have?

780
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Fried chicken and rolled omelette are the classics.

781
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Yes, it brings back childhood memories.

782
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Well then, let's start preparing!

783
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Cook the rice and marinate the chicken.

784
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Should the rolled omelette be on the sweet side?

785
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yes, with a gentle sweetness.

786
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I've finished packing the lunchbox!

787
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Don't forget the picnic mat.

788
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Tea and juice are also ready.

789
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
The bag is light and easy to carry.

790
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Now, let's head to the park!

791
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
(Sound of walking)

792
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's a beautiful day! The sky is so high.

793
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Let's spread out the sheet in the shade of the trees.

794
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Let's lay out the lunchboxes...

795
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Let's eat!

796
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Eating outside is exceptional.

797
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I also brought some fried dumplings with wings.

798
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Oh, they're crispy and delicious!

799
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
The breeze is so pleasant, I feel sleepy...

800
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Shall we take a short nap after eating?

801
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Nice, a peaceful time.

802
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
(Light snoring)

803
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Feeling refreshed!

804
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Shall we go for a walk soon?

805
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Let's walk around the pond.

806
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
The ducks are swimming.

807
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So cute... so relaxing.

808
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Let's read a book on the bench for a while.

809
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Weekend reading is a luxury.

810
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
The wind gently turns the pages.

811
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's already evening in the blink of an eye.

812
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Shall we head home soon?

813
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Would you like to have some ice cream before we go?

814
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Which do you prefer, vanilla or matcha?

815
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Today, I'll have the matcha!

816
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's slightly bitter, a mature flavor.

817
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Let's chat on the way back.

818
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Where should we go tomorrow?

819
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
How about a hot spring trip?

820
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Sounds great, let's relax and unwind.

821
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm looking forward to planning.

822
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
The weekend still continues.

823
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
We've arrived home!

824
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm home!

825
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Welcome back!

826
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
We had a lot of fun today.

827
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yes, it was a fulfilling day!

828
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Shall we have a light dinner?

829
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I think salad and soup will be good.

830
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Alright, I'll prepare them.

831
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Cut the vegetables...

832
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'll warm up the consommé soup.

833
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It's refreshing and delicious!

834
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Thank you for the meal.

835
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
For dessert, let's have some fruit.

836
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Seasonal fruits are the best, aren't they?

837
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Shall we watch a movie today?

838
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Something funny would be nice.

839
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Let's laugh and relax from the fatigue.

840
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'll play it now!

841
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It's already making me laugh from the opening scene.

842
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
This actor's facial expressions are the best!

843
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
The timing of the gags is also great.

844
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
The dubbing adds a lot of flavor.

845
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Haha, my abs hurt from laughing!

846
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Laughing really boosts my energy.

847
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I still have popcorn left.

848
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Thanks! Perfect for watching a movie.

849
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
The climax has arrived!

850
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
As expected, the ending is just as good!

851
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It made me laugh until the end.

852
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
The end credits also have a funny twist.

853
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It was a great refreshment.

854
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Now, let's finalize the plans for the hot spring trip.

855
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'll check the train schedule.

856
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
A departure at 9 a.m. seems just right.

857
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Then leaving the house at 8 o'clock will give us plenty of time.

858
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I want a traditional old-style inn.

859
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
This place has a wonderful open-air bath!

860
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I've made the reservation, I'm looking forward to it!

861
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Let's make a packing list.

862
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Towels, change of clothes, camera...

863
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
A larger bag for souvenirs as well.

864
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Do we need a late-night snack?

865
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Let's buy onsen eggs at the site!

866
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I probably won't be able to sleep because I'm so excited.

867
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But we have to wake up early, right?

868
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Let's start getting ready for bed soon.

869
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Good night, tomorrow is the trip!

870
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Zzz...

871
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
(Alarm sound)

872
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Good morning, it's travel day!

873
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Are you ready?

874
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Yes, the suitcase is all set.

875
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Let's have a quick breakfast.

876
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
A light meal with yogurt and fruit.

877
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Energy recharge complete!

878
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'll call a taxi.

879
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It should arrive soon.

880
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Please take us to the station!

881
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
The morning city is sparkling.

882
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
We've arrived, thank you taxi!

883
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I've already purchased the tickets online!

884
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Checking the station bento at the platform!

885
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
The mountain vegetable rice bento looks delicious.

886
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
The train has arrived!

887
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
My reserved seat is by the window, lucky!

888
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Departure!

889
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
The view from the train window is amazing.

890
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
The mountains are getting closer.

891
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The greenery is dazzling.

892
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Let's open the station bento!

893
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
The aroma is irresistible.

894
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Let's savor it slowly.

895
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
After the tunnel, there's a riverbank.

896
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I can see a cool babbling brook.

897
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Are we arriving soon?

898
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
The next station is our destination!

899
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Let's prepare to get off.

900
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Arrived! The air is clear!

901
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Let's head to the inn by bus.

902
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Autumn leaves are spreading across the window!

903
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's like a painting.

904
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
We've arrived at the inn, with a lovely gate!

905
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Welcome!

906
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Please enjoy some welcome matcha.

907
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It's relaxing, isn't it?

908
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'll show you to your room.

909
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
The scent of tatami mats is refreshing!

910
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
You can see the river from the window.

911
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
After unpacking, let's head straight to the foot bath!

912
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It's warm and feels so good!

913
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Relaxing while listening to the sound of the river.

914
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
The singing of small birds is also soothing.

915
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
We have some time before dinner.

916
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Let's walk along the nearby trail.

917
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
A tunnel of autumn leaves continues.

918
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I want to take lots of photos with my camera!

919
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Click! (taking a photo)

920
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Everywhere you look is a breathtaking view.

921
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
The sunset colors the mountains beautifully.

922
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's about time to head back.

923
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
The inn's noren (doorway curtain) warmly welcomes us.

924
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Dinner starts at 6 PM.

925
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm going to soak in the large bath.

926
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Have a good soak!

927
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
The aroma of the cypress bath is wonderful!

928
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It warms you to the core.

929
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
When you step outside to the open-air bath, you can see the starry sky!

930
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
The stars through the steam, it's a luxury.

931
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm getting hungry.

932
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Let's change into our yukata and head to dinner.

933
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
The menu looks luxurious!

934
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
The appetizer is seasonal hassun (small dishes).

935
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's a work of art in appearance.

936
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Next is a sashimi boat!

937
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It's fresh and sweet.

938
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Let's also enjoy some local sake.

939
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
The aroma gently spreads.

940
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
The main dish is wagyu beef teppanyaki!

941
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
The sizzling sound whets my appetite.

942
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It melts in my mouth...

943
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
This is what happiness feels like.

944
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
The finale is chestnut rice and red miso soup.

945
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Enjoying the flavors of autumn!

946
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The dessert is yuzu sherbet.

947
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Refreshing and perfect!

948
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Thank you for the meal.

949
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Let's relax in the room.

950
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
With the sound of the river as background music...

951
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I also bought hot spring eggs!

952
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
It's time for a late-night snack.

953
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
The runny yolk is the best.

954
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Looking forward to tomorrow morning's bath.

955
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm getting sleepy while watching the stars.

956
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Good night, sweet dreams.

957
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
(The sound of the river continues)

958
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
The night quietly passes by...

959
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
...

960
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
(Birds singing in the morning)

961
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Good morning, let's go to the open-air bath!

962
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
The morning sun is shining on the mountains.

963
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
The warm water and cold air feel so comfortable.

964
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I saw a rainbow through the steam!

965
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's a lucky morning.

966
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Breakfast is a Japanese and Western buffet.

967
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Both grilled fish and croissants!

968
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Don't forget the fresh juice.

969
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Check-out is at 11 o'clock.

970
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Until then, head to the souvenir corner.

971
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
The wooden chopsticks are cute!

972
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I also bought some hot spring flower for my friend.

973
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
While talking about wanting to come again...

974
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
We're returning to the station by bus.

975
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
The return train is a leisurely local train.

976
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Checking the travel photos on the train.

977
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
They all look like postcards!

978
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Maybe I'll upload them to SNS.

979
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Looking forward to the comments.

980
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
The rural scenery is flowing past the window.

981
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
The sadness of the trip coming to an end.

982
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But I also miss home.

983
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
We've arrived, it's 'I'm home' time!

984
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
After all, home is the most comfortable〜

985
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Unpacking can wait until later.

986
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
First, let's lay out the souvenirs.

987
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
The scent of hot spring steam comes back to me.

988
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
While soaking in the lingering memories of the trip…

989
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
There was one more hot spring egg left!

990
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I'll brew some tea and enjoy it.

991
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
The melting yolk is, as expected, the best.

992
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Shall I organize the photos?

993
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Adding notes to the album.

994
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Another volume of memories has been added.

995
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Where should we go on our next trip?

996
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
The sea is nice, and snowy mountains are also good.

997
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Planning the trip is also fun.

998
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Shall we go to bed early tonight?

999
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Good night. See you tomorrow.

1000
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
The story continues—it's not over yet.
