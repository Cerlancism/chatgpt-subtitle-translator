1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good morning.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
How are you?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm fine, thank you.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The weather is nice today.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, it's very good weather.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What will you do today?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
From the afternoon

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
With friends

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Watch a movie.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That sounds nice.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What movie is it?

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's an action movie.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Me too, action.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I like movies.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's something to look forward to.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But first, let's have lunch.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's eat.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, that's a good idea.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What would you like to eat?

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to eat sushi.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's nice.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I also like sushi.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Do you have any recommended shops?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Do you have it?

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes,

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That place is very

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's delicious.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Thank you.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's go there.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's go!

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I hope the road isn't crowded.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, I agree. I don't like traffic jams.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Shall we go by train?

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes, that might be faster.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The station is this way.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll buy the tickets.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Thank you, I'll wait.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I've bought the tickets.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Thank you. Let's go.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The train will arrive in 5 minutes.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's just right.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, the train has arrived!

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's get on.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There are empty seats.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Lucky us!

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Where do we get off next?

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's the third station.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Got it.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What a beautiful view.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Indeed. Spring is beautiful.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, let's get off!

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes, do you have everything?

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm fine.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Is the store nearby?

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, it's a 5-minute walk.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm looking forward to it!

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's here!

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Wow, what a beautiful store.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's go inside.

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Welcome!

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hello, two people.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Please this way.

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Here's the menu.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Thank you. It's hard to decide.

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Everything looks delicious.

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll have the tuna.

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Then, I'll have the salmon.

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
May I order?

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes, go ahead.

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
One tuna and one salmon, please.

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Certainly.

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's exciting!

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm hungry.

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, they've arrived!

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Looks delicious!

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's eat!

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How is it?

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's very tasty!

80
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's great.

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
After we finish eating, it's the movies.

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes, I'm looking forward to it.

83
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Where is the venue?

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's near the station.

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Then, we'll take the train again.

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That's right. Let's walk after eating.

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It will be good exercise.

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm already full.

89
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Shall we go now?

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Could I have the bill, please?

91
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Thank you very much!

92
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thanks for the meal!

93
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The movie theater is this way.

94
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We're almost there.

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Oh, there are a lot of people.

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's a popular movie, isn't it?

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm looking forward to it!

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Have you reserved the seats?

99
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes, everything is set!

100
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's go in!
