Nice, this view is also wonderful.
The leaves of the trees are swaying in the wind.

The birds' chirping is also pleasant, isn't it?
Oh, there's a squirrel over there!
Really! So cute!
Time like this is very healing.
Doing nothing is a luxury, isn't it?
The sunset is gradually tilting.

It's ready!
Let's eat!
Mmm, it tastes like summer!
It's refreshing and delicious.
It blows away the fatigue.
Thank you for the meal!
Let's take a bath now...
How about watching a movie today?
Sounds good! What do you want to watch?
Something heartwarming would be nice.
How about this animated movie?
Oh, that's one I've wanted to see for a while!
Okay, I'll play it.
(Playing sound)
The visuals are beautiful!
The music is wonderful.
I'm drawn into this world.
That character is so cute!
The character is also very nice.
I heard there are tear-jerking scenes in the second half.
Better prepare a handkerchief!
(Emotional music)
I cried.
Me too... it was a good movie.
After watching, my heart feels warm.
I want to watch this again.
Yes, it's a precious film.
Let's go to bed soon.

Good night~
Zzz...
(Night insects chirping)
(Moon visible from the window)
The quiet night passes by...
...

Good morning.
Did you sleep well yesterday?
Yes, I slept soundly!
It's a bit cool today.
I can feel the signs of autumn.

It has a soothing taste.
It's comforting from the morning.
Thank you for the meal!
So, how will you spend today?
I feel like going to the library.
That sounds nice, a relaxing time reading books.
Let's look for a favorite novel.
Let's go out once we're ready!
Yes, I'm leaving!
Take care!
(Quietness of the library)
It has a calm atmosphere.
I'm interested in that shelf.
Yeah, that book... looks interesting!
Let's read a little.
The sound of flipping pages is pleasant.
I lose track of time reading.
It's about time to go home.
Let's borrow this book.
Looking forward to reading more.
(On the way back)
Would you like to stop by somewhere?
There's a dango shop.
We've been tempted by sweets~
Let's get mitarashi dango and anko dango!
I love both!
Let's enjoy!
The sweet and salty flavor is irresistible.
I also want some Japanese tea.
Oh, there might be a tea shop nearby!
Let's stop by for a bit!
Hello~
Welcome!
May I have some sencha?

It's about time for full autumn now.
I want to go see the autumn leaves.
Yeah, maybe next week!
Let's make some plans.
Another thing to look forward to!
The way home is filled with smiles.
Let's rest a little when we get home.
We walked a lot today!
Then, let's continue reading the book while drinking tea.
It's the best afternoon.
A quiet time flows luxuriously...
Let's spend a little more time reading like this.
This novel is interesting because the plot is unpredictable.
The characters are also charming.
I can't help but keep turning the pages.
Oh, it's already this late!
I should start preparing dinner soon.
What should we have today?
How about stew?
It's the season when we want to eat something warm.
I wonder if I have all the ingredients... Yes, I have everything!
Well then, let's start cooking.
Cutting vegetables and simmering them slowly.
The gentle bubbling sound is so soothing.
The whole room is filled with the aroma of stew.
Is it almost ready?
Yes, it looks delicious!
Let's eat.
Wow, it melts in your mouth!
It's hot and warms my heart.
Dipping bread into it makes it even more special.
Ah, happiness~
Do we have any dessert?
There should be pudding in the refrigerator!
Great! Let's eat later!
Would you like to listen to some music after the meal?
Yeah, I feel like listening to some relaxing jazz.
(Jazz piano music plays)
This song is nice.
Sitting on the sofa with my eyes closed...
Losing myself in the sound.
It's truly a luxurious time.
I might doze off a little.
But it's still too early to sleep.
That's right, I think I'll organize my albums.
There are many nostalgic photos.
This one is from elementary school field trip!
Haha, making a funny face~
This photo is from the school festival, isn't it?
It brings back memories of youth.
Each photo has its own story.
I should organize this album more.
Maybe I should digitize them.
I'll try scanning them next time.
Records I want to leave for the future.
Well, it's about time for dessert!
I'll have the pudding~!
The sweetness is just right, it's the best.
I can't stop eating with my spoon.
Maybe I should try making this myself?
Nice, homemade pudding!
Let's try making it on the next holiday.
What kind of mold should I use?
A heart shape, or maybe a star shape!
Our joys have increased again.
Today was a very peaceful day.
The night quietly deepens.
At the end of the day, I feel grateful.
I hope tomorrow will be another good day.
It's about time to sleep, isn't it?
Change into pajamas, brush your teeth...
Get into bed and take a deep breath.
Good night.
See you tomorrow.
(The quiet of the night continues)
Zzz...
(Morning light through the curtains)
Good morning.
It's sunny again today!
I feel refreshed upon waking.
Let's go to the balcony to breathe in the morning air.
The breeze is pleasant.
Shall I make some coffee?
A morning cup is the best.
Today is a perfect day for doing laundry.

Vacuum and wipe the surfaces.
Cleaning the windows makes me feel refreshed!
The room is sparkling clean.
Let's take a break now.
Let's play some music...
Shall I make some tea?
I'm thinking of having green tea today.
Pour hot water into the teapot and steep it carefully...
Take a sip and relax for a moment.
I love this quiet time.
What shall we do this afternoon?
I want to go for a walk.
Shall we walk to the park?
The breeze feels so nice.
I'm getting ready, see you later!
Take care!
(Sunlight filtering through the trees in the park)
There are few people, and it's quiet.
Shall we sit on the bench and read a book?
It's the continuation of the book I borrowed last time.
As I open the page, I am immediately immersed in the story.
This kind of reading is the best.
Sometimes the wind turns the pages.
I hate to finish reading it.
But I want to know what happens next!
To the next chapter... but then,
Huh? My stomach just growled.
Is it already that time?
Shall we head home soon?
On the way back, let's stop by the supermarket.
What should I make for dinner?
I want to eat hamburger steak today!
Then let's buy the ingredients.
Ground meat, onions, bread crumbs...
Don't forget the eggs and sauce.
The checkout was quick!
Well then, let's go home.
I'm home!
Welcome back!
Let's start making the hamburger steak right away!
SautÃ© the onions and let them cool.
Mix with the ground meat and knead it well...
Shape it and fry it until it's sizzling!
It smells so good!
Make the sauce, pour it over...
It's done!
Let's eat!
Fluffy and juicy!
It goes well with rice.
So delicious and happy!
After eating, let's have some tea and chat a bit.
Today was a calm and fun day.
Looking forward to tomorrow again.
Good night.
Zzz...
(The silence of dawn)
Good morning.
Today is the weekend.
I'm thinking about what to do.
That's right, how about a picnic in the park after a long time?
Sounds good! Let's prepare a lunchbox.
Let's make rice balls with lots of ingredients!
What side dishes should we have?
Fried chicken and rolled omelette are the classics.
Yes, it brings back childhood memories.
Well then, let's start preparing!
Cook the rice and marinate the chicken.
Should the rolled omelette be on the sweet side?
Yes, with a gentle sweetness.
I've finished packing the lunchbox!
Don't forget the picnic mat.
Tea and juice are also ready.
The bag is light and easy to carry.
Now, let's head to the park!
(Sound of walking)
It's a beautiful day! The sky is so high.
Let's spread out the sheet in the shade of the trees.
Let's lay out the lunchboxes...
Let's eat!
Eating outside is exceptional.
I also brought some fried dumplings with wings.
Oh, they're crispy and delicious!
The breeze is so pleasant, I feel sleepy...
Shall we take a short nap after eating?
Nice, a peaceful time.
(Light snoring)
Feeling refreshed!
Shall we go for a walk soon?
Let's walk around the pond.
The ducks are swimming.
So cute... so relaxing.
Let's read a book on the bench for a while.
Weekend reading is a luxury.
The wind gently turns the pages.
It's already evening in the blink of an eye.
Shall we head home soon?
Would you like to have some ice cream before we go?
Which do you prefer, vanilla or matcha?
Today, I'll have the matcha!
It's slightly bitter, a mature flavor.
Let's chat on the way back.
Where should we go tomorrow?
How about a hot spring trip?
Sounds great, let's relax and unwind.
I'm looking forward to planning.
The weekend still continues.
We've arrived home!
I'm home!
Welcome back!
We had a lot of fun today.

Alright, I'll prepare them.
Cut the vegetables...
I'll warm up the consommÃ© soup.
It's refreshing and delicious!
Thank you for the meal.
For dessert, let's have some fruit.
Seasonal fruits are the best, aren't they?
Shall we watch a movie today?
Something funny would be nice.
Let's laugh and relax from the fatigue.
I'll play it now!
It's already making me laugh from the opening scene.
This actor's facial expressions are the best!
The timing of the gags is also great.
The dubbing adds a lot of flavor.
Haha, my abs hurt from laughing!
Laughing really boosts my energy.
I still have popcorn left.
Thanks! Perfect for watching a movie.
The climax has arrived!
As expected, the ending is just as good!
It made me laugh until the end.
The end credits also have a funny twist.
It was a great refreshment.
Now, let's finalize the plans for the hot spring trip.
I'll check the train schedule.
A departure at 9 a.m. seems just right.
Then leaving the house at 8 o'clock will give us plenty of time.
I want a traditional old-style inn.
This place has a wonderful open-air bath!
I've made the reservation, I'm looking forward to it!
Let's make a packing list.
Towels, change of clothes, camera...
A larger bag for souvenirs as well.
Do we need a late-night snack?
Let's buy onsen eggs at the site!
I probably won't be able to sleep because I'm so excited.
But we have to wake up early, right?
Let's start getting ready for bed soon.
Good night, tomorrow is the trip!
Zzz...
(Alarm sound)
Good morning, it's travel day!
Are you ready?
Yes, the suitcase is all set.
Let's have a quick breakfast.
A light meal with yogurt and fruit.

I'll call a taxi.
It should arrive soon.
Please take us to the station!
The morning city is sparkling.
We've arrived, thank you taxi!
I've already purchased the tickets online!
Checking the station bento at the platform!
The mountain vegetable rice bento looks delicious.

After the tunnel, there's a riverbank.
I can see a cool babbling brook.
Are we arriving soon?
The next station is our destination!
Let's prepare to get off.
Arrived! The air is clear!
Let's head to the inn by bus.
Autumn leaves are spreading across the window!
It's like a painting.
We've arrived at the inn, with a lovely gate!
Welcome!
Please enjoy some welcome matcha.
It's relaxing, isn't it?
I'll show you to your room.
The scent of tatami mats is refreshing!
You can see the river from the window.
After unpacking, let's head straight to the foot bath!
It's warm and feels so good!
Relaxing while listening to the sound of the river.
The singing of small birds is also soothing.
We have some time before dinner.
Let's walk along the nearby trail.
A tunnel of autumn leaves continues.
I want to take lots of photos with my camera!
Click! (taking a photo)
Everywhere you look is a breathtaking view.
The sunset colors the mountains beautifully.
It's about time to head back.
The inn's noren (doorway curtain) warmly welcomes us.
Dinner starts at 6 PM.
I'm going to soak in the large bath.
Have a good soak!
The aroma of the cypress bath is wonderful!
It warms you to the core.
When you step outside to the open-air bath, you can see the starry sky!
The stars through the steam, it's a luxury.
I'm getting hungry.
Let's change into our yukata and head to dinner.
The menu looks luxurious!
The appetizer is seasonal hassun (small dishes).
It's a work of art in appearance.
Next is a sashimi boat!
It's fresh and sweet.
Let's also enjoy some local sake.
The aroma gently spreads.
The main dish is wagyu beef teppanyaki!
The sizzling sound whets my appetite.
It melts in my mouth...
This is what happiness feels like.
The finale is chestnut rice and red miso soup.
Enjoying the flavors of autumn!
The dessert is yuzu sherbet.
Refreshing and perfect!
Thank you for the meal.
Let's relax in the room.
With the sound of the river as background music...
I also bought hot spring eggs!
It's time for a late-night snack.
The runny yolk is the best.
Looking forward to tomorrow morning's bath.
I'm getting sleepy while watching the stars.
Good night, sweet dreams.
(The sound of the river continues)
The night quietly passes by...
...
(Birds singing in the morning)
Good morning, let's go to the open-air bath!
The morning sun is shining on the mountains.
The warm water and cold air feel so comfortable.
I saw a rainbow through the steam!
It's a lucky morning.
Breakfast is a Japanese and Western buffet.
Both grilled fish and croissants!
Don't forget the fresh juice.
Check-out is at 11 o'clock.
Until then, head to the souvenir corner.
The wooden chopsticks are cute!
I also bought some hot spring flower for my friend.
While talking about wanting to come again...
We're returning to the station by bus.
The return train is a leisurely local train.
Checking the travel photos on the train.
They all look like postcards!
Maybe I'll upload them to SNS.
Looking forward to the comments.
The rural scenery is flowing past the window.
The sadness of the trip coming to an end.
But I also miss home.
We've arrived, it's 'I'm home' time!
After all, home is the most comfortableã€œ
Unpacking can wait until later.
First, let's lay out the souvenirs.
The scent of hot spring steam comes back to me.
While soaking in the lingering memories of the tripâ€¦
There was one more hot spring egg left!
I'll brew some tea and enjoy it.
The melting yolk is, as expected, the best.
Shall I organize the photos?
Adding notes to the album.
Another volume of memories has been added.
Where should we go on our next trip?
The sea is nice, and snowy mountains are also good.
Planning the trip is also fun.
Shall we go to bed early tonight?
Good night. See you tomorrow.
The story continuesâ€”it's not over yet.
